# EC sensor - current state
At the current state there is no EC-sensor that is done. However, there is a simulation file that has been made that is meant to be worked on so that it may one day meet specification for the rest of the project. Thease specifications include but are not limited to: being able to be powered by the given power source, not requireing negative source and have an output range between 0 - 3.3V as not to fry the microcontroller.
