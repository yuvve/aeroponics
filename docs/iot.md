# Ideas:
- Logging:
    - Sensors
    - Energy/water consumption?
- Control:
    - Misting schedules
    - Ligthing
- Protocols:
    - MQTT?
    - Home automation?
- Support multiple towers?
# UI
- CLI (TUI)
- Web-based (some kind of dashboard)
    - Plots
    - Analysis
    - (AI?)
- Alerts / push notifications
## Existing dashboard solutions?
- Home Assistant?
    - Better for DIY, worse for scaling
    - Much nicer UI
    - Possibly (need to check) better mobile experience
    - Easy to set up
    - Directly supports ESPHome
- SCADA (i.e. Rapid SCADA)
    - Less DIY, better scaling
    - Not so modern UI
    - Most likely very bad mobile experience (need to check)
    - Hard to set up
    - ESPHome via MQTT
- Grafana
    - Many different plugins
    - Cannot control devices
    - Need separate DB to store data
    - Both scalable and looks good
    - ESPHome via MQTT or REST
