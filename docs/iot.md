# UI
- CLI (TUI)
- Web-based (some kind of dashboard)
    - Plots
    - Analysis
    - (AI?)
- Alerts / push notifications
## Existing dashboard solutions?
- Home Assistant?
    - Better for DIY, worse for scaling
    - Much nicer UI
    - Possibly (need to check) better mobile experience
    - Easy to set up
    - Directly supports ESPHome
- SCADA (i.e. Rapid SCADA)
    - Less DIY, better scaling
    - Not so modern UI
    - Most likely very bad mobile experience (need to check)
    - Hard to set up
    - ESPHome via MQTT
- Grafana
    - Many different plugins
    - Cannot control devices
    - Need separate DB to store data
    - Both scalable and looks good
    - ESPHome via MQTT or REST
- Own website / server
    - Can be programmed with any popular framework
    - Need backing DB
    - CAN be scalable
    - Most flexible, we can add any functionality we want
    - More complex and time consuming
    - Can have security issues if not done properly and kept updated
- Open Remote
    - Seems to be in-between home-assistant and SCADA
    - No built in ESPHome integration
    - Supports MQTT and REST API
    - Looks nice
    - Easy to use
- OpenHAB
    - Similar to Open Remote
    - Has [ESPHome bindings](https://github.com/seime/openhab-esphome)
    - Doesn't look as well as Open Remote
