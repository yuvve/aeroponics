# Temperature Control
- Hard to regulate in a non-isolated environment.
- System should monitor temperature and alert the user if it goes outside the acceptable range.
# Low vs. High Pressure
- **Low Pressure:**
    - Easier setup, fewer requirements.
    - Produces droplets rather than a fine mist.
- **High Pressure:**
    - Supports better plant growth.
    - Requires pressure-rated piping and fittings.
    - More maintenance (multiple nozzles/sprinklers).
- What is the performance difference between low and high pressure?
- Leaning toward high-pressure system.
    - Purchase piping system (pipes, fittings, nozzles).
        - Materials: PE, PEX, PVC?
    - 3D-print tower modules. Food grade plastic?
    - Plan for one sprinkler level per module (3–4 sprinklers each).
    - Keep pressurized continuously or only during misting cycles (approx. 5 minutes every 30–60 minutes).
