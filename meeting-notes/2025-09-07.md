# Meeting Notes 2025-09-07

# Brought up some points to discuss next meeting that are:

**3D Printing**
- Discussed some different surface treatment such as:
    - Acetone
    - Acid
    - Coat the surface
to get the 3D print to be more inert since it is going to be used for food production
- Consider using more inert plastics such as PVC from the hardware store as the base of the tower instead of 3D-printing
- Limit the size of each module so that one module can be printed on a commercially available printer in one go
- Interview a material technician for food grade plastic to 3D-print with

**Adjustment of planning**
- Consider to put "nutrient dispenser" on hold to LP2
- The nutrient dispenser is not necessary for the tower to work
- Might be too much work in a short time

**Mechanical/electrical connectors**
- "LEGO" connectors can be hard to get correct clutch power with 3D printing
- Maybe use "magnetic pogo pins" as to connect the "modules" together both mechanical and electrical (for potential sensors/LEDs)
