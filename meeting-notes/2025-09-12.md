# Meeting notes
- Prepared NPK solution, only measure salinity (or other chemical) to see if more nutrition is needed. See which chemical runs out the fastest.
- Pressure sensor in series with the pump (between the pump and the pressure tank). Pressure sensors seem to exist prepared for hoses.
- Measure water level to make sure pump is working correctly. Sonic sensor?
- Call Ahlsell and make sure pipes are suitable for drinking water
- In-line pressure sensor not needed, only need a t-junction. Make sure they work in our pressure interval, with sealing etc.
- Measure pressure outside? Like a blood pressure monitor.
- Controller for pressure?
- Controller for misting interval? Magnetic servo.
- Decided on chives. Ask at Blomsterlandet for best nutrient mix, and use this to decide sensors.
- Angle nozzles upwards, better absorption and lower pipe diameter requirement.
- Barrel for tower instead of pipe (difficult to get reasonable dimensions for pipes, minimum 6 m in length from Ahlsell). Tower group needs to discuss this further.
