# Tower design:
- Lego connections, modular.
- What composite and plastic type for the 3D printed parts? Infill?
- Early decision for the type of light to be used. Mounted on top of the tower as a hat or floating above?

# Base design:
- Bucket with lid.

# General
- Sub-issues for the preliminary design goal.
- Finish the preliminary design three weeks from now.
- When to start and finish CAD?
- Ask personell at grow shop:
    - Aeroponics in general
    - Recommended grow lights? Flexible or more specific?
    - What do they recommend we grow? Coriander?
    - What criteria for a specific plant, e.g. nutrients? For maximum growth.
- Ask personell at aquarium shop:
    - General questions about high pressure parts
- Filip and Yuval should be assigned to the CAD part.
- Calle and Simon should be assigned to the high pressure research part.
- William and Filip should choose which sensors to order.
- Ordering parts:
    - High pressure equipment
    - Bucket(s) and lid(s)
    - Sensors
- We've added a lot of issues to be done and organized the project repository.
- 3D print holders for hoses
- We might need a pressure tank and to use PLC
- Presure switches (tryckvakter)

# Lights
- Possibly LED strips for grow lights
