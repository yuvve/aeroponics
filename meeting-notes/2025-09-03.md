# Meeting notes 2025-09-03
- Budget: at least 10k kr, but can even go above 600k kr
- Need to choose a plant that is fast growing
  - It seems that herbs are common in aeroponics
    - Yuvve: would love some coriander
  - Some fast-growing plants:
    - Basil
    - Dill
    - Coriander
    - Parsely
    - Mint
    - Lemon balm (citronmelis)
    - Spring onion
    - Chives
    - Tarragon
    - Oregano
  - Might not be possible to have multiple growing cycles
    - We need to make sure we can atleast verify that the chosen plant gets everything it needs
        - Temperature
        - Humidity
        - Nutrients
        - Nturient atomization (droplet size)
        - pH of the solution
        - electrical conductivity
        - Light
          - Sunlight? Growing lamps?
- What are the roots sitting in?
  - Some kind of airy substrate?
  - The roots should NOT be exposed to light
-  Nutrient dispenser?
## Solution suggestions
### Vertical Tower
#### Sprinklers in every segment
- Completely modular tower
- Each segment connects to the main pump and provides sprinklers for that specific segment
- Sensor placement: most sensors should in the bottom (main) segment
- Possibly a lamp-module that sits on top
#### No sprinklers (dripping from ceiling)
- Completely modular tower
- Main pump pumps to the top of the tower, the mist falls down from the top segment
- Sensor placement: most sensors should in the bottom (main) segment
- Possibly a lamp-module that sits on top
### Horizontal Box
- Horizontal box with sprinklers on the bottom
- Pump tank outside of the box in a separate container
- Sensors can be placed in either or both containers
