**Tower Design**
- Can the tower be 3D-printed and still be food safe?
    - Even if the plastic is food safe, 3D printing itself likely isn’t.
    - Possible solution: coat the inside of the tower.
- Decided to either:
    - Buy PVC pipe and modify it.
        - Could make it modular by cutting into smaller sections and 3D-printing the fittings.
    - Buy a complete aeroponic tower.
        - Would require modifying the internal structure for tubing and nozzle placement.
- Some 3D-printed enclosures and components will still be needed.

**System Features**
- Nutrient dispenser put on hold until LP2, at least.
- Shift in scope: from full automation to a "monitor–inform" system.
    - Example: monitor nutrient concentration and notify the user when more needs to be added.
- Focus on IoT integration to create a "smart" system.

**Water Recycling**
- How often should the water be recycled?
- How to make the process easy for the user?
	- Manual valves at the top and bottom of the bucket.
	- Use electrically controlled valves for automation.
	- Use the pump to remove the nutrient solution when needed.

**Plant Choice**
- First test plant: **chives**.
