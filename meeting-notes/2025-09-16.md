# Meeting notes 2025-09-16
 

 # Modularity changes
 - Went from a pipe to a barrel for the design of the tower
 - Disregarded the "stacking" modularity of the tower
 - Modularity on the high pressure system is still
 - Considering stacking the barrels for some modularity still


 # Water container
 - Considering a separate water container for the water pump

 # Food safety update
 **"Just a prototype"**
- We consider our project as of current as just a prototype and have less concern about food safety and therefore:
    - We will design holders to put plant baskets in
    - We will buy said baskets


# Shopping
**This meeting we all agree on that we need to buy these materials**
- Seeds
- Growth plugs
    - To initiate the growth of the seed
- Baskets
    - To hold the growth plugs initially
    - Later holds the plant itself with only roots
- Growth lamps


- We discussed as to put the shopping list on a .md file on the git or as an Excel file
    - As of this meeting we decided on a Google Docs file for convenience so that multiple people may edit it simultaneously



# Growth tent
- We are still indeterminate if we want to use a growth tent for the aeroponic tower because:
    - Of scalability not being easy with a growth tent incorporated
